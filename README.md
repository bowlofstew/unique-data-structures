Unique Data Structures
==

This is a repository for implementations of irregular data structures written in C.

I have created this repo to practice my C. Since implementing all of the standard data structures (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, Binary Tree, etc.), are boring and overdone, I watned to practice on new ones!

So far, I have:

* Bloom Filter
* Trie
* Doubly Linked List
* Two Four Tree
* Queap

To run, just:
	
	cd /any/data/structure/folder
	make
	./driver
