Unique Data Structures
==

This is a repository for implementations of irregular data structures written in C.

I have created this repo to practice my C. Since implementing all of the standard data structures (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, Binary Tree, etc.), are boring and overdone, I watned to practice on new ones!

So far, I have:

* [Bloom Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)
* [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
* [Doubly Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) [_needed for queap_]
* [Two Four Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%E2%80%933%E2%80%934_tree)
* [Queap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queap)

To run, just:
	
	cd /any/data/structure/folder
	make
	./driver
