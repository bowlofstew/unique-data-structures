Unique Data Structures
==

This is a repository for implementations of irregular data structures written in C.

I have created this repo to practice my C. Since implementing all of the standard data structures (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, Binary Tree, etc.), are boring and overdone, I watned to practice on new ones!

To run, just run:

	make
	./driver
